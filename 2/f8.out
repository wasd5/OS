    lambda = 3.333
    mu = 0.5
    r = 3
    B = 7
    P = 5
00000000.000ms: emulation begins
SIGINT signal caught, no new packets or tokens allowed
00000026.509ms: emulation ends

Statistics:

    average packet inter-arrival time = 0
    average packet service time N/A, no packet served
    average number of packets in Q1 = 0
    average number of packets in Q2 = 0
    average number of packets at S1 = 0
    average number of packets at S2 = 0

    average time a packet spent in system N/A, no packet served
    standard deviation for time spent in system = (N/A, no packet served)
    token drop probability N/A, no token arrived
    packet drop probability = 0
