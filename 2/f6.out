Emulation Parameters:
    number to arrive = 20
    r = 25
    B = 2
    tsfile = w2data/f6.txt
00000000.000ms: emulation begins
00000001.470ms: p1 arrives, needs 4 tokens, inter-arrival time = 1.470ms, dropped
00000014.596ms: p2 arrives, needs 2 tokens, inter-arrival time = 13.126ms
00000014.623ms: p2 enters Q1
SIGINT signal caught, no new packets or tokens allowed
00000018.855ms: p2 removed from Q1
00000019.070ms: emulation ends

Statistics:

    average packet inter-arrival time = 0.00486533
    average packet service time N/A, no packet served
    average number of packets in Q1 = 0
    average number of packets in Q2 = 0
    average number of packets at S1 = 0
    average number of packets at S2 = 0

    average time a packet spent in system N/A, no packet served
    standard deviation for time spent in system = (N/A, no packet served)
    token drop probability N/A, no token arrived
    packet drop probability = 0.333333
